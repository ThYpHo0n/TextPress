9 Days of silence are now over. I doesn't want to repost every new podcast episodes that i've refered to in earlier posts anymore so i want to post just newly discovered mixes/podcast here in this blog. But nervermind, here is a mix made by Carlos B Side from spain. It's finest electro with a good diversity of used tracks. Just the fades are a little bit simple/hard i think.
