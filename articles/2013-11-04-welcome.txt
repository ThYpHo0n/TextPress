Hey,
great to see you here! I've started this blog after my old blog was dead and the domain was shutdown. I want to cover my 3 biggest topics here:
programming, music and politics. All except politics will be written in english. What can you expect from this blog?

## Programming
I'm a developer at [InnoGames](http://www.innogames.com) and write PHP, JS (front/backend) and Java code. I visit most of CCC events and love to hack.

I want to write my daily stories about my work and projects. Also provide you with some solutions or code snippets for some funny/crazy problems (hopefully).

## Music
I love electronic music. In my childhood i started hearing the Thunderdome cds. Then a little bit later it followed by handsup and hardstyle. Today i mostly like dirty electro house and still sometimes hardstyle. I will post recently my favorite tracks and podcasts in this section.

## Politics
Arr, here's a pirate. Since 2008 i'm active in the pirate party germany. I just want to share my opinion on the daily news and the topics out there.
