Say hi to [S.A.R.A.H.](http://eureka.wikia.com/wiki/SARAH) (Self Actuated Residential Automated Habitat). A couple of years ago I enjoyed watching Eureka, a nice scifi tv show. The main character in the show lives in a smart home called Sarah. This was my very first contact with smart home technology. It was just a scifi show but still my vision of living in such a house was born since then. In the last couple of years I lived in some shared flats. There I don't had the intent do build up smart things. But last year I moved together with my girlfriend in a new flat. The smart home vision was still there and I started thinking about the details and how to realize each functionality. In the next blog posts I want to share my vision, ideas, projects and solutions I've build so far and what my upcoming plans are. Here is a short overview about what I've used and achieved so far:

## Hardware
 - 3x [Raspberry PI](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01CEFWQFA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B01CEFWQFA&linkCode=as2&tag=nikre-21) (2x rev3, 1x rev1)

 - Breadboard
 - Pin connector cables
 - 3x Power supply for Raspberry PI

## Software
 - [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/)
 - [Pilight](http://www.pilight.org/)
 - [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast)

## Functionality
 - Remote control lamps/sockets: my lights in the bedroom and living room can be controlled with a smartphone or laptop which enables me to lay in my bed and turn off the lights
 - Synchronized multi-room audio connected to Spotify, Soundcloud and you can connect to it via Airplay. You can control the volume of each room separately

## Planned
 - Add sensor for temperature and humidity in my rooms (living room, bath, kitchen)
 - Control the heaters
 - Monitor everything and create fancy graphs
 - Voice control my existing actions
 - Voice control integration of Amazon Echo / combine it with Siri
 - Indoor location tracking: turn lights on if someone (the system knows of) enters the room
 - Control IR devices in the living room
 - Custom ambilight clone for my tv
