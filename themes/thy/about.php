<p>Hiho,</p>
<p>I'm Nik, a developer at <a href="http://innogames.com/">InnoGames GmbH</a>. Currently living in Hamburg, for me the nicest city in germany. Beside of that i'm developing my own web based 3D tower defense rts game.
I love to hear music not only while coding but i'm better at coding if i can hear to my favorite music ;)
I'm also a soccer fan boy of the great Borrusia Dortmund!
I enjoy my movie flatrate with my Apple tv at home, (i like popcorn and taccos while watching some great movies or tv series).
In my spare time i play golf (if the weather conditions are nice enough).
And at the end of the day i'm just a human who wants some cuddling/kisses/love, but currently i don't share my lifetime with someone.
